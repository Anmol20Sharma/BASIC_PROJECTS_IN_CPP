## 🎲 4. Number Guessing Game

A console-based program where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

### ✨ Features
- Randomly generates a number between a lower and upper limit  
- Prompts the player to guess the number  
- Provides hints: **Too low** or **Too high**  
- Tracks the **number of attempts**  
- Simple and interactive console interface  

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- **Random Number Generation** (`rand()`, `srand()`, `time(0)`)  
- **Loops** (`do-while`) for repeated guesses  
- **Conditional Statements** (`if-else`) for hint logic  
- **Input/Output** (`cin` / `cout`)  
- **Variables & Counters** to keep track of attempts

## 📝 5. To-Do List Manager

A console-based program to manage daily tasks with options to add, view, update, and delete tasks, all saved persistently in a file.

### ✨ Features
- Add new tasks with **title, due date, and due time**  
- View all tasks with **status** (Pending / Done)  
- Mark tasks as **done**  
- Delete tasks  
- **Persistent storage** using `tasks.txt`  
- User-friendly console menu  

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- **Structs** for task representation  
- **Vectors** for dynamic task storage  
- **File Handling** (`ifstream`, `ofstream`) for persistence  
- **Loops & Conditional Statements** for menu and task operations  
- **Input/Output** (`cin` / `cout`)
